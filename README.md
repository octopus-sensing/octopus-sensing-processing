Octopus Sensing Processing
==========================

Octopus Sensing Processing is a real-time data processing for [Octopus Sensing](https://octopus-sensing.nastaran-saffar.me/). 
It can be used for processing data in real-time. You can define your favorite processor and process your data in real-time and publish the processing result. For example if you define an emotion recognition processor, Octopus Sensing Processing can prepare the input of your processor in real-time and publish your created prediction by streaming them as json data or other applications could send a request for receiving them when they needed the processing result.

[Octopus Sensing Processing](https://github.com/octopus-sensing/octopus-sensing-processing) is 
a separated project and can be installed if we need to visualize data. 
It can be used for displaying recorded data with
the same format as we recorded through Octopus Sensing.
